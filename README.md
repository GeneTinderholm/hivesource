This is an app for time management. Logging in, you will be able to view a list of projects. Each project has tasks. Click the top right (nav bar) to add project.

When on a project page, you can view all tasks. If a user adds a task it will automatically be updated on your page.

If a user volunteers for a task, that user will also appear on the task table.
