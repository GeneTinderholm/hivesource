# Hive-Source

This started as a one day hackathon project that I've since fleshed out a bit more. It is still under development.

Summary: Hive-source is an app for time management. Logging in, you will be able to view a list of projects. Each project has tasks. Click the top right (nav bar) to add project. When on a project page, you can view all tasks. If a user adds a task it will automatically be updated on your page. If a user volunteers for a task, that user will also appear on the task table.

1. Clone this repo. Run the following command from the terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/vikingeducation/nov-fantastic-parakeet

2. To install the module dependencies, run the following command from within the main project folder:

3. Install mongodb.

4. Start the project. The following command should start it listening on port 3000 when run from the main project folder.
